# Control Engineering Lab Report I

The aim of the lab is to understand the *physical models*, *mathematical models* and *state-space equations*. Moreover, understanding of **Simulink** to model our systems in a simulation environment is also covered.

## Introduction

I'm going to choose **Spring-Mass-Damper** system as an example physical model. Before diving into a simulation environment, I'll first cover the mathematical models of our example system. Then, I'll use Matlab Simulink to model our system in a simulation environment. Also, cover the state-space equations of our system and model those equations in Simulink.

## Spring-Mass-Damper System

The system we're using here is **Spring-Mass-Damper** system. In the above figure, we could see that **m** is the mass, spring constant **k**, damping ratio **b** and the applied force **f**. We are going to use **Newton's Second Law of Motion** to model our system.
